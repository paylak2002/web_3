== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

Google has made it difficult to embed a new Earth Tour into a WP post, and their gadget doesn't seem to work on any site that I tested it. This plugin uses a combination of a shortcode in the post and a custom field for the tour file to display the tour. Requires a Google Maps API key.
